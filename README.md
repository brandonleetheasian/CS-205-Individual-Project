# CS-205-Individual-Project
    
    By Brandon Lee and Clayton Chisholm
    
    For our project we made a restaurant class. A restaurant has customer and orders. Each order has a dish,
    and with each dish, ingredients. We wanted our classes to represent a restaurant as much as possible, 
    so we added fucntionality with things such as having customer priority, keeping track of how much money
    was made, and having customers be able to request changes to their dish by being able to remove ingredients.
